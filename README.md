# Autonomous-Robots-Ex1

This Python project simulates a drone navigating through a 2D grid environment using Pygame. The drone moves to explore the environment, avoid obstacles, and stops after reaching 50% battery. The simulation provides a visual representation of the drone's movement and sensor data.
